          Your Troop tokens have two sides: fighters and advisors. Fighters act like normal Troops. Advisors may be moved but otherwise have no effect on the game. Advisors may coexist with allied Troop tokens. The state of your troops is tracked on a per territory basis. (Ex. If advisors move to a territory with fighters they become fighters. If Troop tokens move to a territory with no other BG Troop tokens you choose what they become.) You may ship Troop tokens as fighters or advisors.

          At the beginning of Ship & Move phase you may flip any advisors to fighters, they automatically become fighters if no other factions are present. This is the only way a territory with advisors can switch to fighters.
          
          If a faction moves into a territory where you have fighters you may flip those fighters to advisors if that faction wasn't already in that territory. (Fighters can't become advisors when a faction reinforces a territory.)
          
          When a faction ships from off planet you may put an advisor at their destination (if you have no fighters there) or a fighter in the polar sink.
