          <p>
            Players can make any kind of verbal deals or bribes between one
            another. Once made, these deals and bribes may be stated aloud and
            must be honored. A player cannot renege on a deal or bribe.
          </p>
          <h2>VALID:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Information.</li>
            <li>Future actions.</li>
            <li>Spice.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>INVALID:</h2>
          <ul>

            <li>Leader discs.</li>
            <li>Troop tokens.</li>
            <li>
              Actions that are unrelated the the current game being played.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Spice exchanged as part of a binding deal is placed in a faction's
            Bribe pile, in public, in front of the player's shield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players are allowed to offer deals that are impossible for them to
            actually perform, but they are not allowed to accept them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a deal has been accepted by both parties, the parts the players
            want to be binding must be stated in public.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can chose to keep details of a deal private, but this can cause
            bad things to happen:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players can lie to each other and betray each other.</li>
            <li>
              Private communication was done poorly, and no other players
              verified what was said.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Bribes</h1>
          <p>The spice can be collected at the Collection phase.</p>
          <p>
            Spice on the Bribe pile may not be removed from the bribe pile until
            the Collection phase, regardless of if the deal was dissolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collecting the Spice from the Bribe pile is a single instant (
            <em>every faction performs this at the exact same time</em>) that
            happens at the very end of the Collection phase.
          </p>

          <Outline variant="example">
            <h1>"Thrown fights"</h1>
            <p>
              An very common binding deal revolves around "blocking" strongholds
              in order to prevent other players to win that turn.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use the word "Thrown fight" and it has the official
              definition:
            </p>
            <p>Players decide amongst themselves who will be the victor.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Neither player will play a weapon Treachery card.</li>
              <li>Neither player will reveal a Traitor.</li>
              <li>
                Neither player will play Break Conditioning to gain it's effect.
              </li>
              <li>The losing player will dial 0.</li>
              <li>The losing player will play a leader that is low enough.</li>
              <li>The winner's battle plan can have any dial or leader.</li>
