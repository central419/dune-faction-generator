          <h1>Declaration</h1>
          <p>
            Each faction must publicly reveal the number of Treachery Cards in
            their hands. A player can never have more than four cards in their
            hand at any one time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A player cannot bid for Treachery Cards if they are at their hand
            limits.
          </p>
          <h1>Dealer</h1>
          <p>
            Count the number of factions not at their hand limit, and for each
            of them set aside one card from the top of the Treachery deck. If
            the Treachery deck has fewer cards than players who can bid, the
            cards remaining in the deck are set aside. The discard pile is then
            shuffled together and cards equal to the difference are drawn and
            placed separately to the first pile. The first pile will be
            auctioned off first, and the second pile second.
          </p>
          <h1>Auction</h1>
          <p>The first card in the stack is now auctioned for Spice.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first player in Storm Order will open bidding on the first
              card. If that player already has 4 Treachery Cards the next player
              who does not have 4 Treachery Cards opens bidding.
            </li>
            <li>
              They may bid one or more Spice or pass. Bidding then proceeds to
              the next player in Storm Order who may raise the bid or pass until
              all other players pass in a row. The top-bidding player then pays
              the number of Spice they bid to the Emperor, or the Spice Bank if
              the Emperor is not in the game, and takes the card into their
              hand.

          <p>
            No player may bid more Spice than they have, except with permission
            from their ally if any, or the Emperor.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a faction wins the bidding, but cannot pay for the card due to
            not having enough Spice, the bid is considered illegal and the
            bidding on the card in question is restarted with the same starting
            bidder, however the player who made the illegal bid is unable to bid
            on that Treachery Card.

          <h1>Next Starting Bidder</h1>
          <p>
            In subsequent bidding during this phase, the First Player who can
            bid, to the right of the player who opened the bid for the previous
            card, begins the bidding for the next card. In this way every player
            who can bid gets a chance to open the bidding for a Treachery Card.
          </p>
          <h1>End of Bidding</h1>
          <p>
            Bidding for Treachery Cards continues until all cards available for
            bid have been auctioned off or a card is not bid on by anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a card is passed by everyone, all remaining cards are returned to
            the top of the Treachery deck in the order they were dealt and the
            bidding round is over.
          </p>
          <h1>Transparency</h1>
          <p>
            The number of (not the type) Treachery cards each player holds is
            public information during the bidding round. Nobody is allowed to
            hide the number of cards they hold at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a player has a full hand, they must pass on all cards up for bid.
          </p>
          <Outline variant="generic">
            <h1>Bidding Etiquette</h1>
            <p>
              While these are not strict rules, we suggest they are complied
              with to keep the bidding round as short as possible
            </p>
            <p>
              A pause should be taken before the use of faction powers like
              Ixian deck Splitting or Atreides Prescience where they announce to
              the table that they are about to use them thus giving players a
              fair chance to use karama cards, or faction powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We suggest 30 seconds to a minute should be spent before the
              bidding of each card to allow the factions to make deals on card
              knowledge, subsidies and bidding strategy. In general, when a
              player is asking for subsidy from their ally or the Emperor, we
              recommend asking for an amount of Spice and accepting a yes or no
              answer to keep the round moving. This will also allow allies to
              share their plans on who should buy what and how much Spice they
              can share between them. Complex deals should be saved for this
              time period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once bidding starts on a card, each players bid should take no
              more than 10 seconds. Simple deals can take part in this time
              however the game should not be paused to allow a complex deal to
              take place.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it is a players turn to bid they should have priority in
              making simple deals. This means that other players should be quiet
              and interfere minimally when they make deals during their 10
              seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
              We suggest that players frequently flouting these conventions be
              warned, with a potential limit being imposed that they may only
              state their bid and nothing else once bidding has started.

            All revivals happen in Storm Order for purposes of the Bene
            Tleilaxu's Revival Income, and the Bene Tleilaxu always revive their
            Troop tokens and leaders last.

          <h1>Leader Revival</h1>
          <p>
            Once a player has only, or has had only 1 available leader, they may
            revive one leader per turn until all of their leaders have been
            revived.

                To revive a leader, a player must pay that leader's strength in
                Spice to the Bene Tleilaxu, or the Spice Bank if the Bene
                Tleilaxu is not in the game.

                A revived leader can be played normally and is still subject to
                being a traitor.

                Tleilaxu Tanks. This leader cannot be revived again until all of
                the player's other revivable leaders have been revived, killed,
                and sent to the Tleilaxu Tanks again.

          Phase 7: Shipping & Movement
        </Title>
        <Text>
          <h1>Storm Order</h1>
          <p>
            Shipment and Movement happens in Storm Order by default. Each
            player's turn consists of one shipment and one movement. If the
            Spacing Guild is in the game, their Ship When You Wish advantage
            takes precedence to Storm Order. After the Spacing Guild has used
            this advantage, Shipment and Movement proceeds in strict Storm Order
            until all factions have had a chance to Ship and Move.
          </p>
          <h1>Shipment</h1>
          <p>
            A player may make one shipment of any number of tokens from their
            reserves to any one territory on the map. A player must pay spice to
            the spice bank for their shipment or to the Guild if they are in the
            game. The cost of shipping off-planet reserves is one spice per
            token shipped into any stronghold or city, and two spice per token
            shipped to any other territory. The Fremen player does not have to
            pay as their reserves are on the far side of Dune, see their faction
            sheet for details.

        <Text columns={2}>
          <h1>Restrictions</h1>
          <p>
            No player may ship into a sector in storm or a stronghold already
            occupied by two other players. Otherwise, shipments may be placed in
            any territory. No player except the Spacing Guild and their ally may
            ship tokens from the board back to their reserves.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            The Stronghold Shield Wall counts as a Rock Territory in terms of
            Shipment, Movement and occupation limits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each player may move, as a stack, any number of their Troop tokens
            from one territory into one other territory. The default move limit
            is one Territory.
          </p>

          <h1>Ornithopters</h1>
          <p>
            When a player has any amount of Troop tokens in Arrakeen or Carthag
            has access to ornithopters. If the faction shipped forces into
            Arrakeen or Carthag, they immediately gain access to Ornithopters
            for their movement.
          </p>

            <Text>
              <h1>Movement</h1>
              <p>
                Each player may make only one move per turn. Sectors have no
                effect on movement, i.e., tokens can move into or through a
                territory ignoring all sectors. As sector's only function is to
                regulate the movement and coverage of the storm and spice
                collection. No token except for the Fremen’s may move into, out
                of, or through a sector in storm (including non-sand
                territories). If a factions forces are split into 2 or more
                sectors of the same territory, they may all leave the territory
                with one movement action as a stack. To recombine these forces
                into one stack while remaining in that territory requires one
                movement action.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many territories occupy several sectors, so that a player may
                move into and out of a territory which is partly in the storm
                and part out, so long as the group does not pass through the
                part covered by the storm. When ending a move in a territory
                lying in several sectors, a player must make clear in which
                sector of the territory they choose to leave their tokens. The
                polar sink is never in storm. Tokens do not block movement with
                one exception: Like shipment, tokens cannot be moved into or
                through a stronghold if tokens of two other players are already
                there. Otherwise, tokens are free to move into, out of, or
                through any territory occupied by any number of tokens.
